# Introduction


**Welcome** to *my* ~~super~~ SUPER awesome `blog` post!

My undergraduate Data Science senior capstone students 
at Ramapo College of New Jersey are required to use Quarto
to typeset their final reports, known as "final blog posts".
The Quarto Markdown (QMD) file used to create this blog post
can serve as a starter file for your own blog post project.

The repository housing this blog post (and associated files) can be
found [here](https://github.com/debbieyuster/ecots24).

## Features

Your blog post can contain a mix of richly formatted text,
equations, images, code, plots and tables generated from code,
citations and cross references, and much more.

Here's a mathematical equation, written in $\LaTeX$ syntax:
$$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

Here's an example of a "callout":

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::

Here's an example of a Python code cell. If you'd like to view the
code, click the drop-down triangle next the word "Code".
The code can be configured to be either displayed or hidden by
default, and the output can be displayed or suppressed.

```{python}
import random

n = 10
sum = 0
print("Let's roll a die", n, "times:")
for i in range(1, n+1):
  roll = random.randint(1, 6)  # roll the die
  print("Roll", i, "landed on:", roll)
  sum += roll
print("The sum of the", n, "die rolls is:", sum)
```

Next let's display a table:

| Report Format | Fun Level |
|------|------|
| PDF  | Normal |
| HTML | High   |

: Fun level of various report formats {#tbl-formats}

Quarto will automatically number your tables and figures, and you
can refer to them without needing to know those numbers.

Here is an example of a cross-reference: See @tbl-formats.
If this document were longer, clicking the hyperlink would cause
your cursor to jump right to the table.

Blog posts allow you to do all sorts of stuff that can't
be done in a static PDF document - like embed videos!

# Learn more

This blog serves as a (fairly) minimal working example.
Your blog post can include so much more, for example:

* Tables and (interactive) plots generated on the fly from datasets
* Captions and hyperlinked references
* Embedded videos or applets
* Bibliographies, using BibTeX
